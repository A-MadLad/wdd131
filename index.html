        <p>
          Hello, class peeps! My name is Adam Judd. I currently live in New
          Mexico, but I've also lived in Arkansas, Okinawa, North Dakota,
          Georgia, Utah, and Texas. I grew up in a military family, which is why
          I've lived in so many places and why it's difficult for me to stay in
          one place even today. I love watching movies, riding my bike (it's a
          stationary bike, but I will buy a real one at some point though),
          watching sports (mostly the NFL, but I like to watch the NBA playoffs
          as well), watching sports news, spending time with my family
          (especially my baby niece. She is so cute!), playing video games (I'm
          doing this particular activity a lot less these days), and reading
          about/studying philosophy. I've recently been reading a book about
          hermetic philosophy, and it's very entertaining. They basically
          believe that the universe is within the brain of an advanced
          intelligence. I'm excited to be in this class and improve my skills in
          web development!
