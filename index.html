          Hello, class peeps! My name is Adam Judd. I currently live in New
          Mexico, but I've also lived in Arkansas, Okinawa, North Dakota,
          Georgia, Utah, and Texas. I grew up in a military family, which is why
          I've lived in so many places and why it's difficult for me to stay in
          one place even today. I love watching movies, riding my bike (it's a
          stationary bike, but I will buy a real one at some point),
          watching sports (mostly the NFL, but I like to watch the NBA playoffs
          as well), watching sports news, spending time with my family
          (especially my baby niece. She is so cute!), playing video games (I'm
          doing this particular activity a lot less these days), and reading
          philosophy. I've recently been reading a book about
          hermetic philosophy, and it's very entertaining. They basically
          believe that the universe is within the brain of an advanced
          intelligence.<br> I'm excited to be in this class and improve my skills in
          web development!

        <h3>New Mexico</h3>
        <hr>
        <img src="images/nm-flag.jpg" alt="New Mexico state flag" class="left">
        <p class="pleft">New Mexico is the fifth largest of the fifty states by area,
           but with just over 2.1 million residents, ranks 36th in population and 46th in population density.
           Its climate and geography are highly varied, ranging from forested mountains to sparse deserts; 
           the northern and eastern regions exhibit a colder alpine climate, while the west and south are warmer and more arid. 
           The Rio Grande and its fertile valley runs from north-to-south, creating a riparian climate through the center of the 
           state that supports a bosque habitat and distinct Albuquerque Basin climate. Oneâ€“third of New Mexico's land is federally owned, 
           and the state hosts many protected wilderness areas and national monuments, including three UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 
           the most of any U.S. state. </p>
